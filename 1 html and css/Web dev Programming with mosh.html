    *   visual heirarichy is about drawing attention of user towards imortant elements (towrds those elements first which we want). we do this wth of position, colors, borders, shadows spacing etc. 
    Fundamentals: 

    users focus on top first then to other. attention usually flow from top to bottom.
    images draw a lot of attention (use meaningful). if there's text on page and we want to move user attention to text then not use image or use smaller images. larger images draws more.
    white space


    *   visual heirarichy for text elements:
    more font size to important texts.
    add font weight
    lighten color of less important texts

    insta doest not want users to move attention awAy from pics therefore it use small letters

    *   visual h bw components:
    usuallyy developer highlughts the one component/card he want the user to choose ie showing expensive cards with other color and the cheapest (the one he want the user to give attention/click) one with another color (or by using bg color)
